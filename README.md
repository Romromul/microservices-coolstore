# Cool Store Microservice Demo

CoolStore is a containerised polyglot microservices application consisting of services based on .NET Core, NodeJS, NATS and more running on Kubernetes

It demonstrates how to wire up small microservices into a larger application using microservice architectural principals.

# Services

There are several individual microservices and infrastructure components that make up this app:

1.  Catalog Service - .NET Core service and MongoDB, serves products and prices for retail products
2.  Cart Service - .NET Core service which manages shopping cart for each customer
3.  Inventory Service - .NET Core service and SQL Server, serves inventory and availability data for retail products
4.  Pricing Service - .NET Core service which is a business rules application for product pricing
5.  Review Service - .NET Core service and SQL Server running for writing and displaying reviews for products
6.  Rating Service - .NET Core service running for rating products
7.  Coolstore Gateway - [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) service running that serving as an API gateway to the backend services
8.  IDP - Identity Provider using [IdentityServer4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) to authentication with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for the whole stack
