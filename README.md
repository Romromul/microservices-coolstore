CoolStore is a containerised polyglot microservices application consisting of services based on .NET Core, NodeJS and more running on Service Mesh.

It demonstrates how to wire up small microservices into a larger application using microservice architectural principals.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10:** The OS for developing and building this demo application .
- **[Windows Subsystem Linux - Ubuntu OS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)**: The subsystem that helps to run easily the bash shell on Windows OS.
- **[Docker for Desktop (Kubernetes enabled)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):** The easiest tool to run Docker, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes on Mac and Windows.
- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with AKS).

<details>
  <summary><strong>µServices</strong></summary>

There are several individual µservices and infrastructure components that make up this app:

|-----|---------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Catalog | Serves products and prices for retail products | Node.js | Mongo | [`http://localhost:5002`](http://localhost:5002) or [`http://api.coolstore.local/catalog`](http://api.coolstore.local/catalog/swagger)

## Installation

<details>
  <summary><strong>Development environment</strong>: Up and Running locally with "Docker for Desktop"</summary>

1. Make sure we have **`Docker for Desktop`** running with **`Kubernetes`** option enabled. We need to install **`kubectl`**, **`helm`** and **`istioctl`** on the build machine as well.

2. From current console, type `bash` to enter `Linux Subsystem (Ubuntu)`

3. Then `cd` into your root of project

```
> ./deploys/scripts/build-all-images.sh
```

It should run and package all docker images.

4. Download and install [istio-1.0.0](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.0.0) on the box, and unzip it into somewhere, then initialize it with following commands

```
> cd <istio-1.0.0 path>
> kubectl create -f install/kubernetes/helm/helm-service-account.yaml
> helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade
```

5. Get `istio-ingressgateway` IP address

```
> kubectl get services istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -o=jsonpath={.spec.clusterIP}
> 10.96.34.68 <== for example, we get the IP as the left-hand side
```

6. Create `values.dev.local.yaml` file in `deploys/charts/coolstore`, and put content like

```
gateway:
  ip: 10.96.34.68
```

7. Apply `istioctl` command to `coolstore` chart

```
> helm template deploys/charts/coolstore -f deploys/charts/coolstore/values.dev.yaml -f deploys/charts/coolstore/values.dev.local.yaml > deploys/k8s/dev-all-in-one.yaml
> istioctl kube-inject -f deploys/k8s/dev-all-in-one.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

8. Add hosts file with following content

```
127.0.0.1 api.coolstore.local
127.0.0.1 id.coolstore.local
127.0.0.1 coolstore.local
```

Waiting for the container provision completed

9. Install `coolstore-istio` chart

```
> helm install deploys\charts\coolstore-istio --name coolstore-istio
```

10. Access to following URLs

```
> curl -I http://coolstore.local # website
> curl -I http://api.coolstore.local # api gateway
> curl -I http://id.coolstore.local # identity provider
```

11. Clean up `coolstore` chart as

```
> kubectl delete -f deployment/istio/dev-all-in-one.yaml
> helm delete coolstore-istio --purge
> helm delete istio --purge
```

**Notes**:

1. Global path
> Set `PATH` for `docker`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `istioctl`.

2. Run with Nginx (not recommendation)
> If you want to run just only `Kubernetes` + `nginx-ingress` go to `deploys/charts/coolstore/values.yaml`, and modify as following
>```
> nginx:
>    enabled: true
>```
> Then run the `helm` command as
> ```
> helm install --name cs-nginx stable/nginx-ingress
> ```

## Service Mesh

[Istio](https://istio.io) provide a wealth of benefits for the organizations that use them. There’s no denying, however, that adopting the cloud can put strains on DevOps teams. Developers must use microservices to architect for portability, meanwhile operators are managing extremely large hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. Istio lets you connect, secure, control, and observe services.
