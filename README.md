# Cool Store Application on Service Mesh Demo

> This project is inspired from [coolstore project](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/coolstore-microservice) by [jbossdemocentral](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral) & [Red Hat Demo Central](https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral)

CoolStore is a containerised polyglot microservices application consisting of services based on .NET Core, NodeJS and more running on Service Mesh.

It demonstrates how to wire up small microservices into a larger application using microservice architectural principals.

### Up and Running

Make sure we have `docker for windows` edge running with `kubernetes` option enabled. We need to install `kubectl`, `helm` and `istioctl` on the build machine as well.

From current console, type `bash` to enter `Linux Subsystem (Ubuntu)`

Download `istio 0.8.0`, and unzip it into somewhere

```
> cd <istio 0.8.0> path
> kubectl create -f install/kubernetes/helm/helm-service-account.yaml
> helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade
> helm install install/kubernetes/helm/istio --name istio --namespace istio-system --timeout 1000
```

Then `cd` into your root of project

```
> ./cs-build.sh
> ./cs-inject-istio.sh
```

Add hosts file with following content

```
127.0.0.1   id.coolstore.local
127.0.0.1   coolstore.local
```

Waiting for the container provision completed

```
> curl -I http://coolstore.local
> curl -I http://api.coolstore.local
```
